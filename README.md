# Marketing Data Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to analyze marketing data and predict customer behaviors. The dataset includes various features such as age, job, marital status, education, and financial indicators. By analyzing this data, the project provides insights to optimize marketing campaigns and improve customer engagement.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **age**: Age of the customer.  
- **job**: Job role of the customer (e.g., management, technician).  
- **marital**: Marital status (e.g., single, married, divorced).  
- **education**: Education level (e.g., primary, secondary, tertiary).  
- **default**: Indicates if the customer has credit in default (yes/no).  
- **balance**: Average yearly balance in euros.  
- **housing**: Indicates if the customer has a housing loan (yes/no).  
- **loan**: Indicates if the customer has a personal loan (yes/no).  
- **contact**: Type of communication contact (e.g., telephone, cellular).  
- **day**: Last contact day of the month.  
- **month**: Last contact month of the year.  
- **duration**: Duration of the last contact in seconds.  
- **campaign**: Number of contacts performed during this campaign.  
- **pdays**: Number of days since the customer was last contacted.  
- **previous**: Number of contacts performed before this campaign.  
- **poutcome**: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign (e.g., success, failure).  
- **y**: Target variable indicating if the customer subscribed to the service (yes/no).
